EP- 10

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below 2000000.

Solution:
    Since the upper limit is extremely large, cost = O(n^3)...
    Use "Sieve of Eratosthenes" to solve this problem

Algorithm:
    1. Create a list l of consecutive integers {2,3,â€¦,N}.
    2. Select p as the first prime number in the list, p=2.
    3. Remove all multiples of p from the l.
    4. set p equal to the next integer in l which has not been removed.
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until p2 > N, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes
